-Author of the .cs file being reviewed:
Luke Wingert
-Number of minutes taken to complete the review:
15 mins.
-Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:
I think all player classes are in high quality,except you gonna use 2 hours to figure out how that detector working.
-Specific comments on code quality:
The detector is a great idea, it makes player interacts perfectly with other classes. All player classes are easy to understand even without comments. Coupling is low I think, also I think there's high cohesion since each class only focus on one job.
-A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
Currently, I don't think there's situation that the player class can't handle, even if there is, the player class is easily to maintain and update.
