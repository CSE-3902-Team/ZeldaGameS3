Sprint 3
LevelManager.cs
Author of cs file: Austin Motz

Specific comments on code quality and readability:
	The readability is overall fine. 
	Overall the code quality is also good.
	There is tight coupling, but that comes with the amount of things you have to draw for each room.
	Cohesion seems very good, I think as long as the csv files are the same format, you could draw anything,

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change
	A change to the level manager could be to link all the rooms together in the level manager while creating them, or call a level linker method.
