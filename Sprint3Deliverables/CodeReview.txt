What is readable: variables and methods are named well. the comment about checking for friendly things is a nice touch

Comments on code quality: class has low coupling - the player and projectile classes just as expected. 

Suggestions: We may be able to make a method that is IsFriendlyProjectile() in the IProjectile class to get rid of all of the if statements for individual friendly projectiles.
