Reflection: This sprint was very difficult. Figuring out collision detection was the most challenging task as was making it usuable for every class.
Projectile collision detection proved to be the hardest to implement. Both player and enemy decided to store projectiles within their own classes.
Both player and enemy decided to handle this differently so it was very chlalenging to get both classes working. Room loading and csv file creation
was straightforward.
