What is readable: method names are very useful for understanding what the code is doing. Just by the class name it's obvious this is a container
class that is just calling update on everything

Comments on code quality: Class has high cohesion, but high coupling. This coupling is pretty much avoidable to due to the nature of the class.
I didn't see any code smells in the class, no repeated code.

Suggestions: Remove the player property, reduce coupling. This would be easy to implement as the property is only referenced within the class.
Just use the instance varible instead.
