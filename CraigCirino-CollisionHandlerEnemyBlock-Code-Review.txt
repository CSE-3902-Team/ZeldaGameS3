-Number of minutes taken to complete the review:
20 mins.
-Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:
Very readable code. Easy to understand the bats can "fly" over blocks but the rest of the enemies switch directions based on the direction the collision is coming from. Although the last line in which the position is actually updated took some time to decipher.
-Specific comments on code quality:
The code has low coupling due to only 3 dependencies. The class also has high cohesion because it only contains 1 method which contains the entire functionality of the CollisionHandler for this collision case.  
-A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
I would suggest getting rid of magic number, 5, which appears twice in updating the position. This makes the position logic much more confusing than it needs to be because the magic numbers do not tell you why it is being used in the calculation liked a named variable would.
